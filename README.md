# ML-User-Expert-Recommendation-System
I used machine learning model for creating user-expert recommendation system. 
I developed this project by using python language. This will give us three expert recommendations. Here recommendations are based on attributes of the item. 
Attributes that we are using : Languages Pref 1,2,3 ; Personality Type 1,2,3 ; Hobbies 1,2,3 ; Which soft skills do you want to engage on - 1,2,3 and Which areas would you like help with - 1,2,3.
Project visibility on github : private or not uploaded for its Confidentiality.
I powered XXXXXX.com website with AI/ML. AI means machine has the ability to scan the web or profile and pull content from mentions.
